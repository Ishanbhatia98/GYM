/*
Algorithm:
Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST. 
Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE. Assign the key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first. 
While mstSet doesnâ€™t include all vertices 
Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has a minimum key value. 
Include u in the mstSet. 
Update the key value of all adjacent vertices of u.
To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, 
if the weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, 
update the key value as the weight of u-v
